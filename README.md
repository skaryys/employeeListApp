# Frontend task

## How to run it

```
export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider //if node version is too new
yarn
yarn start
```

## Notes

- I have setup the eslint and prettier for better formating and code control
- I have updated React for 18 version
- For basic CSS reset, I used normalize.css
- I used custom font for better appearance from Google Fonts
- For some reason, the attached URL `https://run.mocky.io/v3/ce160a84-83a8-45cf-9cf7-755d61acef54` does not work (error 404) for me, so created endpoint with the attached data `https://run.mocky.io/v3/fa231fba-19d3-42d2-ad4e-70eb9970c2e3` instead
- I have created custom hook to fetch data (hooks folder)
- For styling, I use styled-components
- Extra credits should be also finished
